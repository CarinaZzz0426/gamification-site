    <h1>How Apps Use Gamification to Keep Us Hooked</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>In the digital age, gamification is quietly reshaping the way people interact with everyday apps. By using gamification elements such as point accumulation, level advancement, achievement badges and reward mechanisms, this design concept turns the generally monotonous process of using apps into something more interesting and valuable. As a case in point, consider Duolingo, a popular language learning app. The key to its success lies in its clever use of gamification logic. The simple feedback loop it builds allows users to instantly perceive the results of their learning. The "disengagement anxiety" triggered by the continuous Streak mechanism becomes an invisible motive for steady learning, and the visualization of the progress bar and proficiency level enhancement more intuitively presents the user's growth path. These designs work together to help users develop stable learning habits, transforming language learning from a task to a sustainable way of self-improvement.</p>

<!Gamification Definition>
    <h2 id="gamification"><a href="#content">What is Gamification?</a></h2>
    <p>Singh (2023) has explained such phenomena "The use of game design features, mechanics, and concepts in education aims to produce more engaging and fun learning environments. The objective is to incorporate aspects like rewards, competition, achievements, and progress tracking into instructional content in order to make learning a fun and participatory experience." This observation pinpoints the core value of gamification in the educational scenario. Gamification breaks the traditional mode of teaching where the teacher unilaterally instills knowledge and turns the course content into a series of challenges that can be interacted with. The previous passive acceptance of knowledge is now replaced by dynamic goals that are constantly updated. Students will not only pay more active attention to their own learning progress, but also compare themselves with their friends to gain extra motivation from it, and feel a sense of accomplishment with each small goal accomplished. This kind of positive feedback on the little progress in learning is the key to the self-driven motivation that gamification design can deeply inspire in learners.</p>


<!Duolingo Case Study>
    <h2 id="case-study"><a href="#content">How Duolingo Uses Gamification to Keep Users</a></h2>
    <p>The latest data (Duolingo, released in 2024) shows that Duolingo is growing quite rapidly. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the number of daily active users grew by 65% to 26.9 million compared to the same period the previous year. The number of monthly active users also grew by 46%, climbing to a total of 88.4 million. The number of paid subscribers showed significant growth of 57%, reaching 6.6 million at the end of the quarter. At the same time, the company's total revenue increased by 45% to $151 million. It's also highlighting that Duolingo returned to profitability, posting a $12.1 million profit in the quarter compared to a loss the year before. This impressive data shows that more and more people are using Duolingo to learn languages and are willing to pay for its quality service. It also shows that Duolingo is not only attracting a large number of users, but is also successfully converting them into paying customers, and that the company's profitability is increasing while maintaining steady and strong growth. Duolingo's growth has been driven by the company's use of gamification to create engaging learning experiences. The positive impact of Duolingo's gamification strategy is not only reflected in the learning habits of its users, but also in its impressive growth numbers.</p>
    <h3 id="widget"><a href="#content"><li>Addictive and Delightful Widget</li></a></h3>
    <q>Each time a user completes a lesson, they gain XP points, badges, and their daily streak count increases by one. These instant rewards give users a constant sense of accomplishment in the learning process. What's even more, it sends out addictive and enjoyable reminders via the owl Duo, such as "Time to practice!" or "Don't let it break!". Also, as shown in Figure 1, Duo's reminders get more and more desperate as midnight approaches. These reminders are like a caring and persistent partner, constantly encouraging users to get back to studying for fear that they will lose their hard-earned streak, and play an important role in helping users stick with their studies and stay on track. It is due to these detailed and fun gamification designs that make users more willing to immerse themselves in learning.</q>

    </figure>

    <h3 id="streak"><a href="#content"><li>Winning Streaks and Streak Freezing</li></a></h3>
    <p>According to Duolingo's official blog, these reminders do indeed work. Their experiments found that "simply reminding a learner of their current streak, and whether or not it's at risk, is hugely valuable. (Mansur, 2024)" According to the data, "learners using the widget had far better retention on Duolingo." There is actually a psychological principle behind this, that is, people feel worse about losing something than they do about gaining something new, because people are averse to loss. That is why the app is so focused on protecting streaks. When users skip a day, they risk losing hard-won progress, which creates a strong incentive to return. To further solidify this mechanism, the app even offers features such as "winning streak freezing," which gives users the opportunity to make up a missed day to preserve progress if they accidentally miss a study or want to take a break. This clever use of psychological triggers makes the app stickier and helps users develop learning habits.</p>

    <h3 id="competitive"><a href="#content"><li>Competitive Features</li></a></h3>
    <p>Duolingo also includes features such as friend streak, leaderboards, progress bars, and daily special tasks to keep users engaged. The friend streak feature encourages users to stay connected and accountable by allowing them to maintain a shared streak with friends. Duolingo (2025) has found that, "learners with at least one shared streak are 22% more likely to complete their daily lesson, and that likelihood increases the more friend streaks you have!" They also introduced about leaderboards, "This competitive feature of Duolingo monitors your progress each week against learners around the world—and you can climb up (or down) based on your study efforts!" It allows learners to compete with others by comparing experience values, while progress bars visually show how close users are to completing a lesson or level. Such visual feedback helps users break down large goals into smaller and manageable steps. Duolingo does not just inform users that they are gaining progress, it shows it in these visual ways, which is the key to remaining motivated to learn for a long time.</p>

    <h3 id="trial"><a href="#content"><li>14-Days Free Trial</li></a></h3>
    <p>Duolingo's free trial strategy is another key part of its growth model. The app offers a 14-day free trial of its premium version, Super Duolingo, which gives users access to extra features such as unlimited hearts, personalized practice, and ad-free learning. Once users have established some interaction with the app, they are more likely to recognize the value of advanced features. According to Duolingo Blog (Gustafson, 2025), "free trials are shown to users who are most likely to enjoy the benefits of Super and convert to paid subscribers." This approach ensures that the trial feels valuable and targeted. In fact, Duolingo (Gustafson, 2025) reports that "over half of our subscribers started as free trial users," and it shows how important this strategy is to growth. By allowing users to experience the benefits firsthand, such as faster progress and uninterrupted learning, Duolingo taps into their desire for better results. Not only does this strategy help increase conversions, but it also supports Duolingo's record user growth and revenue growth.</p>

    <h3 id="notifications"><a href="#content"><li>Notification System</li></a></h3>
    <p>Notably, the notification system of Duolingo closely connects with the Week 3 course material on social media dynamics, especially regarding digital boundaries and online validation. In the same way that social media platforms use push notifications to pull users back into their apps, Duolingo utilizes fun and timely alerts, such as widgets and notifications with an angry tone, to trigger users to re-engage. This strategy reflects what was discussed in lecture about how "push notifications disrupt focus and pull users back in," which creates habitual engagement cycles. According to Koninck (2025), "think of that little red dot over the app icon that indicates a new item, or something unresolved. Just that small feature increased daily active users by 1.6%. While that doesn’t sound like a huge number, they add up when you have millions of users!" These notifications can shape user emotions by triggering fear of missing out and a desire to maintain social status through streaks or achievements. Just like the course discussed the importance of setting digital boundaries, users may need to manage app notifications to maintain a healthy balance. Duolingo's success both emphasizes the power of digital engagement tools in shaping user behaviour and reveals its potential risks of digital engagement tools in shaping user behaviour.</p>

    <h2 id="psychology"><a href="#content">The Psychology Behind Gamification</a></h2>
    <figure>
      <img src="dopamina.png" alt="Neurotransmitter" width="700">
      <figcaption>Figure 4: Neurotransmitter (Playmotiv, 2020)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Gamification is effective for apps like Duolingo due to its psychological impact on users because it keeps users engaged. According to Dutton (2023), "Each time users achieve a milestone or earn rewards in a gamified system, there’s a release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. This dopamine rush encourages users to continue engaging, chasing after the next reward." Playmotiv (2020) also explains that reward-triggered dopamine "is a neurotransmitter of our central nervous system and it is considered as the main pleasure centre of our brain". Gamification continually triggers the release of dopamine by setting small, frequent rewards, offering users a sense of pleasure when completing a task or earning a reward. 
    <br><br>
    Duolingo capitalizes on this natural response of the brain with elements such as the streak mechanic, progress bar, and celebratory animations that work together to build a loop, where users keep coming back to the app in order to get the pleasure that comes with achievement again. Playmotiv (2020 ) emphasizes that every time users accomplish something, dopamine is released, which motivates them to seek that sense of reward again, and this explains why users often have trouble getting out of gamified apps. This biological response is a powerful tool that, when used thoughtfully, can help build positive habits like daily language learning. Users are motivated not only by the content itself, but also by the satisfaction of reaching goals, earning rewards, and feeling successful. 
    <br><br>
    Boskamp's research (2023) shows that "A sizeable 89% of surveyed workers said that gamification makes them feel happier and more productive at work," which highlights why apps that include game elements often have higher user retention rates. Duolingo taps into this by offering clear goals, immediate feedback, and visible progress markers. The app creates a loop where users set targets, receive positive reinforcement, and are motivated to continue (Figure 5). This is supported by Dutton's idea that "Users complete tasks to progress to new levels or unlock new features, keeping them engaged and motivated to interact further." Duolingo's badges, levels, and streaks give users a sense of achievement and mastery, which encourages them to return day after day.</p>

<!pros and cons>
    <h2 id="pros-cons"><a href="#content">Pros and Cons of Gamification</a></h2>
    <p>Gamification has both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, gamification boosts users' motivation to learn and turns what might otherwise be a boring learning process into a more enjoyable process. Earning rewards, reaching milestones, and seeing progress can all increase engagement and help users stay consistent. Boskamp's (2023) research suggests that, "gamification can improve learning retention by up to 40%," which shows its effectiveness in educational apps like Duolingo. 
    br><br>
    On the other hand, the downsides of gamification should not be ignored. It can put pressure on the user, especially the psychological burden of trying to maintain a winning streak, and can even lead to addictive behavior. Users are constantly worried about losing the learning progress they have made, and may overuse the app in order to avoid such negative feelings. As BeeLiked points out, "the dopamine hit from rewards can drive compulsive behavior," which highlights the importance of striking a balance when utilizing gamification. For Duolingo users, finding the balance between enjoying the motivation to learn that comes with gamification and avoiding the undue stress that comes with it is a concern.</p>

<!tips>
    <h2 id="mindful"><a href="#content">Tips for Mindful Use</a></h2>
    <p>It is important to stay in control while enjoying the convenience and fun of gamified apps. Users can start by setting clear boundaries, for example, by actively turning off notifications that are not necessary to minimize distractions from the outside world. At the same time, set a time limit for how long you can use the app each day. Users can set a reasonable amount of time based on individual study programs and living arrangements. The advantage of this is that it can ensure the consistency of study, but not let the apps take up too much of life time. More importantly, it is crucial always to make it clear that the core goal in using Duolingo is to learn, not just to maintain a winning streak. Put attention back to the accumulation of knowledge and skill improvement, and open the app every time with a clear learning task in order to make learning more meaningful.
    <br><br>
    Users should pay more attention to app's state and motivation and think about why using. Is it because the willing to learn and progress, or is it simply because of the fear to miss the winning streaks. Through this kind of self-awareness, users can obtain a clearer grasp of the relationship with apps. In this way, gamified apps will not be over-used and disrupt user's life, nor do users miss out on the learning boost that gamification can bring by rejecting the apps altogether. Only in this way can users truly enjoy the benefits of gamification applications while avoiding the pitfalls it may bring. Let technology be a tool to help people grow, not to dominate the life.</p>
